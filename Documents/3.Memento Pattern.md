# Memento Pattern

The memento pattern allows an object to be saved and restored. It has three parts:

1. The **originator** is the object to be saved or restored.
2. The **memento** represents a stored state.
3. The **caretaker** requests a save from the originator and receives a memento in response. The caretaker is responsible for persisting the memento and, later on, providing the memento back to the originator to restore the originator’s state.

While not strictly required, iOS apps typically use an Encoder to encode an originator’s state into a memento, and a Decoder to decode a memento back to an originator. This allows encoding and decoding logic to be reused across originators. For example, JSONEncoder and JSONDecoder allow an object to be encoded into and decoded from JSON data respectively.

## When should you use it?

Use the memento pattern whenever you want to save and later restore an object’s state.

For example, you can use this pattern to implement a save game system, where the originator is the game state (such as level, health, number of lives, etc), the memento is saved data, and the caretaker is the gaming system.

You can also persist an array of mementos, representing a stack of previous states. You can use this to implement features such as undo/redo stacks in IDEs or graphics software.

## What should you be careful about?

Be careful when adding or removing Codable properties: both encoding and decoding can throw an error. If you force unwrap these calls using try! and you’re missing any required data, your app will crash!

To mitigate this problem, avoid using try! unless you’re *absolutely* sure the operation will succeed. You should also plan ahead when changing your models.

For example, you can version your models or use a versioned database. However, you’ll need to carefully consider how to handle version upgrades. You might choose to delete old data whenever you encounter a new version, create an upgrade path to convert from old to new data, or even use a combination of these approaches.
