# Observer Pattern

The observer pattern lets one object observe changes on another object. Apple added language-level support for this pattern in Swift 5.1 with the addition of Publisher in the Combine framework.

This pattern involves three types:

1. The **subscriber** is the "observer" object and receives updates.
2. The **publisher** is the "observable" object and sends updates.
3. The **value** is the underlying object that's changed.

> **Note**: this chapter provides a high-level introduction to @Published properties, but it doesn't get into all of the details or powerful features offered in the Combine framework. If you'd like to learn more Combine, see our book *Combine: Asynchronous Programming with Swift* (http://bit.ly/swift-combine).

**When should you use it?**

Use the observer pattern whenever you want to receive changes made on another object.

This pattern is often used with MVC, where the view controller has subscriber(s) and the model has publisher(s). This allows the model to communicate changes back to the view controller *without* needing to know anything about the view controller's type. Thereby, different view controllers can use and observe changes on the same model type.

**What should you be careful about?**

Before you implement the observer pattern, define *what* you expect to change and under which conditions. If you can’t identify a reason for an object or property to change, you’re likely better off *not* declaring it as var or @Published, and instead, making it a let property.

A unique identifier, for example, isn’t useful as an published property since by definition it should never change.
