# Strategy Pattern

The strategy pattern defines a family of interchangeable objects that can be set or switched at runtime. This pattern has three parts:

- The **object using a strategy**. This is most often a view controller when the pattern is used in iOS app development, but it can technically be any kind of object that needs interchangeable behavior.
- The **strategy protocol** defines methods that every strategy must implement.
- The **strategies** are objects that conform to the strategy protocol.

## When should you use it?

Use the strategy pattern when you have two or more different behaviors that are interchangeable.

This pattern is similar to the delegation pattern: both patterns rely on a protocol instead of concrete objects for increased flexibility. Consequently, *any* object that implements the strategy protocol can be used as a strategy at runtime.

Unlike delegation, the strategy pattern uses a *family* of objects.

Delegates are often fixed at runtime. For example, the dataSource and delegate for a UITableView can be set from Interface Builder, and it’s rare for these to change during runtime.

Strategies, however, are intended to be easily interchangeable at runtime.

## What should you be careful about?

Be careful about overusing this pattern. In particular, if a behavior *won’t* ever change, it’s okay to put this directly within the consuming view controller or object context. The trick to this pattern is knowing *when* to pull out behaviors, and it’s okay to do this lazily as you determine where it’s needed.
