# Delegate Pattern

The delegation pattern enables an object to use another “helper” object to provide data or perform a task rather than do the task itself. This pattern has three parts:

- An **object needing a delegate**, also known as the **delegating object.** It’s the object that *has* a delegate. The delegate is usually held as a weak property to avoid a retain cycle where the delegating object retains the delegate, which retains the delegating object.

- A **delegate protocol**, which defines the methods a delegate may or should implement.

- A **delegate**, which is the helper object that implements the delegate protocol.

  By relying on a delegate protocol instead of a concrete object, the implementation is much more flexible: *any* object that implements the protocol can be used as the delegate!

## When should you use it?

Use this pattern to break up large classes or create generic, reusable components. Delegate relationships are common throughout Apple frameworks, especially UIKit. Both DataSource- and Delegate-named objects actually follow the delegation pattern, as each involves one object asking another to provide data or do something.

Why isn’t there just one protocol, instead of two, in Apple frameworks?

Apple frameworks commonly use the term DataSource to group delegate methods that *provide* data. For example, UITableViewDataSource is expected to provide UITableViewCells to display.

Apple frameworks typically use protocols named Delegate to group methods that *receive* data or events. For example, UITableViewDelegate is notified whenever a row is selected.

It’s common for the dataSource and delegate to be set to the *same* object, such as the view controller that owns a UITableView. However, they don’t have to be, and it can be very beneficial at times to have them set to different objects.
