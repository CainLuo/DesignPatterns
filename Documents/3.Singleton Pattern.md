# Singleton Pattern

The singleton pattern restricts a class to only *one* instance. Every reference to the class refers to the same underlying instance. This pattern is extremely common in iOS app development, as Apple makes extensive use of it.

The “singleton plus” pattern is also common, which provides a shared singleton instance that allows other instances to be created, too.

## When should you use it?

Use the singleton pattern when having more than one instance of a class would cause problems, or when it just wouldn’t be logical.

Use the singleton plus pattern if a shared instance is useful *most* of the time, but you also want to allow custom instances to be created. An example of this is FileManager, which handles everything to do with filesystem access. There is a “default” instance which is a singleton, or you can create your own. You would usually create your own if you’re using it on a background thread.

## What should you be careful about?

The singleton pattern is very easy to overuse.

If you encounter a situation where you’re tempted to use a singleton, first consider other ways to accomplish your task.

For example, singletons are *not* appropriate if you’re simply trying to pass information from one view controller to another. Instead, consider passing models via an initializer or property.

If you determine you actually *do* need a singleton, consider whether a singleton plus makes more sense.

Will having more than one instance cause problems? Will it ever be useful to have custom instances? Your answers will determine whether its better for you to use a true singleton or singleton plus.

A very most common reason why singletons are problematic is testing. If you have state being stored in a global object like a singleton then order of tests can matter, and it can be painful to mock them. Both of these reasons make testing a pain.

Lastly, beware of “code smell” indicating your use case isn’t appropriate as a singleton at all. For example, if you often need many custom instances, your use case may be better as a regular object.

## Key points

You learned about the singleton pattern in this chapter. Here are its key points:

- The singleton pattern restricts a class to only one instance.

- The singleton plus pattern provides a “default” shared instance but also allows other instances to be created too.

- Be careful about overusing this pattern! Before you create a singleton, consider other ways to solve the problem without it. If a singleton really is best, prefer to use a singleton plus over a singleton.

RabbleWabble is really coming along! However, it’s still missing a key functionality: the ability to remember your score.

Continue onto the next chapter to learn about the **memento** design pattern and add this functionality to the app.
